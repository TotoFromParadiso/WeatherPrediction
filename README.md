# WeatherPrediction
This project uses machine learning to predict weather conditions such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity using historical data from OpenWeatherMap. After data cleaning and feature engineering, Random Forest models were trained and tested, showing accurate results and demonstrating the power of AI in weather forecasting
